<h2>What 'is' a Built Application?</h2>

<p>Applications are essentially a zip file stored with a time stamp</p>

<p>The zip file is formatted as a PhoneGap application</p>

<ul>
	<li>All HTML, JS and CSS are contained in the WWW directory</li>
	<li>package.json - Manifest file used by Content Sync.  Content paths and last modified date reside in this file.</li>
	<li>The zip file can be downloaded and built with PhoneGap (Initial builds of applications must do this)</li>
	<li>The zip file is also used for OTA updates</li>
</ul>
