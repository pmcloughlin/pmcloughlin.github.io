<h2>How does an Application Get Built?</h2>

<p>An application consists of two nodes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Content Node</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Contains all authored content for the application</li>
		<li>Content is moved to publish via activation</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Configuration Node</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Contains Content Sync and PhoneGap configuration information</li>
		<li>The blueprint for how the application will be built</li>
		<li>Before an author can update an application this node must be present on the publish instance</li>
	<ul>
</ul>
