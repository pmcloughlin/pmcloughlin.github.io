<h2>Mobile Application Authoring Issues</h2>

<p>How to author a single page application?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Phonegap applications are by nature single page applications</li>
	<li>Most applications use a UI framework to hide groups of elements acting as screens</li>
	<li>Example: jQueryMobile uses 'div' tags to represent pages within a single page application</li>
	<li>Authoring one large page is cumbersome and gives no visualization to the application</li>
	<li>Applications screens should be authored as close to the layout as possible</li>
	<li>In AEM Apps Angular JS is used to allow a multiple page authoring experience while still building a single page application</li>
</ul>
