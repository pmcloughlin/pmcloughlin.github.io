<h2>Angular JS</h2>

<p>How does AEM Apps Use it?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Applications are built as single page Angular JS apps</li>
	<li>Individual components are built using Angular JS</li>
	<li>Each component contains a .jsp for markup and a javascript file for its controller</li>
	<li>Angular's two way binding is used to communicate between markup and controller</li>
	<li>As an application is built the .jsp file is transformed into an angular template via a content handler</li>
	<li>The controller javascript file is added to the project via normal clientlibs functionality</li>
	<li>Having each component become a template is genius because it solves a major authoring issue</li>
</ul>
