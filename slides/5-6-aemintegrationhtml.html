<h2>Content Sync</h2>

<p>How does AEM Apps use it?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each time the Content Sync cache is updated the application is built from its content</li>
	<li>Content handlers are used to render or copy each file based on the configuration nodes</li>
	<li>On startup, mobile application calls to the Content Sync node with current timestamp</li>
	<li>If new content is available it is downloaded via a zip file and stored to the device using the file API</li>
	<li>Content is swapped out and application is launched</li>
</ul>
